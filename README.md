#msc-thesis
This repository will contain my M.Sc. thesis which is temporarily titled as
"Computational Approaches to Modeling Brain Mechanisms".
Since the projects have different off-side collaborators, I have restricted
rights to make publicly experiment/model's data and unpublished results
available without getting permission from co-authors and project PIs. After
conference/journal submissions and defending my thesis, all related source code/files/data
will readily be available under a specific F/OSS licence.


>  At the same time I don't think this whole "openness" notion is new. In fact I often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas and making it into what science is today, and the incredible advances that we have had. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do. So openness is not something new, it is something that actually has worked for a long time.
